a work in progress.

todo

- [ ] Confirm that nested components work
- [ ] Run asset pipeline (presumably, package.json goes in route, and paths need to reflect that)
- [ ] test in forestry
- [ ] test on netlify

n.b. I believe all modules will need to be public, while the content directory can be private
