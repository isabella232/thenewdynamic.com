Part of our event at Happy Cog with Jeff Escalante and Jeff Posnick.

You can get all the Progressive Web "App" benefits, like instant, offline-first loading, without building a single-page app! This talk will be a architectural exploration of an example static site PWA, generated with 11ty.


Jeff Posnick is a member of Google's Web Developer Relations, working on libraries and guidance around building PWAs.
