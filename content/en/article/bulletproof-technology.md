  Using Bulletproof Technology to Build a Better Website
---

There are few things in life that evolve faster than technology. New innovations happen every day. It can be exhilarating. It can also be exhausting trying to keep up with it all—the latest widget, the latest update…you get the idea.

As technology gets more sophisticated, so have the people who are using it. User expectations are at an all-time high. The need for having a fast, near-perfect tech experience is real. Let’s use websites as an example.

End users want a lot from the sites they visit, no matter the type—ecommerce, educational, entertainment, nonprofit, media, etc. All the pieces of a site need to come together in perfect harmony in order for a user to have a positive experience. 

First, you need to engage users the minute they hit your home page. Then, you need to keep them on the site…and keep them coming back for more engaging visits. 

### So, what are the key elements behind a great site experience?

Intuitive navigation  
Quality content  
Engaging visuals/media  
Unfailing site security  
Seamless speed

Before we look at some of these elements in detail, let’s examine how a traditional website typically comes to life and gets served to an end user.

## The Tech Stack

One cornerstone of website creation is the tech stack. In simplest terms, a tech stack is a collection of software that works together to achieve a certain goal. For our purposes here, the goal of the tech stack is to serve a website to the general public and end users.

The legacy tech stack of the web is known as LAMP. Site platforms like Drupal, Joomla, and WordPress run off its collection of software. Here’s the quick acronym breakdown:

Linux is the operating system.
Apache is the stack’s web server.
MySQL is the stack’s database. 
PHP is the coding language used for website development.

LAMP requires several steps in order to publish a website page. There’s a database lookup, the returning of various information snippets to the server, and the loading of various site files. All of this happens in just a few seconds…

…but when it comes to a user’s perception of your website, every second counts.

## The Need for Speed

Remember those key website elements we mentioned earlier? Perhaps one of the most important from that list is site speed.

Consider these numbers about user perception and performance delays:

The bottom line is that most users expect a site page to load in 1 second or less. If a page load misses that critical time frame, the user immediately starts to lose focus on the site. 

Once a user is turned off by a slow page load, there’s usually no turning back. 

They will not fill out your form.
They will not buy your product.
They will not donate to your cause.
They will very likely not return to your site. 

To ensure that our clients’ sites always have the speed a user wants, we employ a different type of tech stack we call Bulletproof Technology. 

What makes Bulletproof Technology a better solution for building websites? Let’s find out.

The New Dynamic = Bulletproof Technology

> Bulletproof Technology is based on a website architecture called the JAMstack 

**(J = JavaScript, A = APIs, M = Markup).**

If JAMstack is the foundation for Bulletproof Technology, then its 4 pillars are:

Simplicity
Speed
Scalability
Savings

Bulletproof Technology represents a shift in how a modern-day website is built. And while there’s no exact parallel of technologies between the legacy LAMP stack and the Bulletproof Technology stack, there are 2 big components that make it superior:

Bulletproof Technology takes the database out of the equation when a user visits the site.
Bulletproof Technology fundamentally alters how we use the server.

Removing the Database

Remember the trip to the database that the server has to make when using the legacy tech stack? That trip takes time. What if you could eliminate it? Well, that’s what Bulletproof Technology does.

Bulletproof Technology allows us to prebuild our websites. When a site visitor arrives at a page, there’s no work for the server to do because our tech stack eliminates the “trip to the server” step. 

We build out all the site’s HTML pages in advance and put them on the web for users to consume instantly. This is a big timesaver – and remember that every second counts.

Turning the Server on Its Head

A website’s software and all of its files typically sit on a single server. If you’re in the U.S. that server might be in New York, Texas, wherever The server, the software, the files all interact with each other fast to serve up the site experience… 

…but when a site is built with Bulletproof Technology, the experience is even faster. 

Because of the way we prebuild our website, we can put the entirely of the site’s content on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and accelerate everything.

How a Content Delivery Network Works

A CDN essentially duplicates your website files and makes them available on multiple servers all over the world. The site is delivered to the user from the server located closest to them.

All websites can use CDNs to serve assets from their site. But only prebuilt sites have the ability to serve the HTML from CDNs around the world.

Legacy websites might try to sidestep database lookup with caching tactics. But they’re still left serving the site pages from a single server. And it’s important to note that caching adds another layer of site complexity that can be finicky.

Beat the Traffic

While speed is a must-have for any website, it’s not the only important factor. The ability to effectively manage site traffic is also critical.

A typical website can get overwhelmed fast when a high volume of traffic hits at once. Too much traffic in a short period of time pushes the server to its limits. It has to process many database lookups at once. That’s why all too often you’ll see a website fail just when you need it most. 

The Bulletproof Technology stack doesn’t require the heavy-duty processing step in times of high traffic – or any time for that matter – because there’s no database lookup. 

And there’s also no chance of a server going down because it’s maxed out.

Here’s a great example of a site traffic meltdown:

One of our clients published an article of national interest during a crisis – just one week before they started working with us. 

As expected, the influx of traffic to their WordPress site caused their site to crash fast.

The client spent two days trying to recover and keep their website up. They added more servers and other layers of complex technologies to keep things running. And they spent a lot of money doing so. 

A website built with Bulletproof Technology remains relatively stable, even in times of increased traffic. There’s only a minimal service fee to pay in order to utilize more bandwidth.

The Hack-Proof Website

Another benefit of Bulletproof Technology is greater site security. With no database in the picture, hackers literally (or, virtually) have nothing to hack. 

A website’s database is typically the main target for hacker infiltration. With Bulletproof Technology, any access to a database is done before the site is ever published. There’s simply nothing to hack. This significantly reduces what technologists call the ‘surface area’ for attacks. The fewer entry points to interference, the better.

Today’s Tech for Tomorrow’s Websites
Because of its simplicity, speed, scalability, and cost-saving features, Bulletproof Technology continues to gain popularity among developers – and has proved that it’s a highly effective modern architecture for those looking for a better website.
