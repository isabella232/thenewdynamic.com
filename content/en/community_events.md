title: Community & Events
description: As Jamstack pioneers we started one of the original
  Jamstack-focused events series. We run a popular community Slack and manage a
  site devoted to Jamstack resources, with tools, articles, and a showcase.

We've hosted 27 events so far and have spoken at and given workshops at the annual Jamstack Conference.
