By checking an opt-in box, clicking on “I accept” or otherwise accepting this Agreement via digital signature, or using the Services, Client acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement. If Client is using the Services ("Services") on behalf of an entity, partnership, or other organization, then Client represents that they: (i) are an authorized representative of that entity with the authority to bind that entity to this Agreement and (ii) such entity agrees to be bound by this Agreement. If Client does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, then they are not permitted to use the Services.


#### 1) Description of Services:

Website software updates

Implementation of third-party services ("Third Party")

#### 2) Fees, Expenses, and Payment

Access to the Services may require Client to pay Fees, as may be further described at https://www.thenewdynamic.com/agile-pricing-plans/. All Fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable, unless otherwise provided herein.

a) The cost and payment schedule for Services is set forth on the applicable subscription.  

b) Charges do not include third party expenses and disbursements, including but not limited to third party software programs, which may be required to run the Websites. Client shall either pay separately for any third party software programs and updates thereof, or The New Dynamic will include the fees in Client's invoice.  

c) The New Dynamic reserves the right to charge late fees on overdue accounts.  

d) Any additional work or material revisions beyond initial scope set forth on the SOW will be charged on an hourly basis for services performed that have been approved in advance by Client.  

##### Changes to the Services

If Client requests changes to the Services, Client shall deliver a written change order to The New Dynamic and The New Dynamic shall submit a revised SOW to Client for written approval. The New Dynamic may cease rendering Services until the revised SOW has been approved by Client, and, if required, any additional fees are received by The New Dynamic.

#### 3) Third Party Services

For Third Party services implemented by The New Dynamic, including for the Websites' compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the Client, under its sole responsibility, hereby expressly maintains and undertakes as follows:

(a) to have read and accepted the privacy policy and terms and conditions of any Third Parties whose services are used in the Websites;

(b) to be aware that the services provided by the Third Parties for the compliance of the Websites are not a substitute for the professional legal advice required to ensure that the Websites does not violate any applicable laws and regulations;

(c) to be aware that the Supplier, in proposing the use of the services referred to at point b), is not providing any kind of legal advice, nor it is in any way suggesting or encouraging the Client to avoid the compliance review of the Websites by their trusted lawyer which is, on the contrary, strongly recommended.

(d) to be aware that it is the precise duty of the Client to approve in writing the contents resulting from the use of third-party services before their publication and, in any case, before their finalization;

e) to be aware that it is the Client’s precise duty to inform the Supplier of any additions and/or changes that may be necessary in relation to the contents generated via the services provided by the Third Parties. On the other hand, should the Supplier point out by its own initiative the need for any updates, it is understood between the parties that the liability for refusing such updates lies entirely with the Client, which also undertakes to indemnify and hold the Supplier harmless from any direct or indirect damage that may arise as a result of their decision;

f) to be aware that the services provided by the Third Parties are not provided by the Supplier, who, therefore, cannot in any way be held liable in relation to the proper functioning or availability, or both, of such services.

g) to indemnify and hold harmless the Supplier (and any companies controlled or affiliated with it, its representatives, directors, agents, licensees, partners and employees), from any obligation or liability, including any legal fees incurred to defend themselves in court, that may arise in relation to the content obtained and/or provided through the use of the services provided by the Third Parties.
