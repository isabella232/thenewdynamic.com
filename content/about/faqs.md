- heading: How is your pricing different from other web development firms?
  copy: We consider our pricing structure to be very different from other firms –
    in a good way, of course. As a client of the New Dynamic, you choose a plan that
    works best for your specific needs. Each of our plans is based on a monthly fee
    structure, and each plan is unique in the level of service it offers. Our goal
    is to be flexible to your needs and always available to you, yet mindful of your
    budget.

- heading: How do I know this is right for me?
  copy: Our clients tend to be organizations whose web presence is critical to their
    success and whose needs evolve over time. If you desire to have a dedicated web
    team but you don't want the expense/hassle of having one in-house, then you are
    a likely candidate for our services. If, on the other hand, you need a simple
    website (one that, for instance, doesn't require content modeling or information
    architecture), then you are likely better off with a lower-cost service provider.

- heading: What plans do you offer?
  copy: We offer three primary price plans. Payments are made one month in advance
    and are non-refundable. Simply choose the plan you’re most comfortable with, and
    we go from there.

- heading: Which plan is best for me?
  copy: 'Our team can help you determine which plan is the best for your organization.
    Besides your budget, some other factors that may help determine which plan makes
    the most sense for you are: technical complexity of your website; size of your
    website in terms of pages and content; number of websites that need to be managed.'

- heading: What is a concurrent site?
  copy: We charge per site, but many of our clients have multiple properties they
    want us to manage.

- heading: Can I change plans?
  copy: Yes. You can scale your plan up or down based on what is deemed manageable
    for you and what is considered optimal for your web presence. We recommend seven
    to twelve months on a more active plan to allow for more iteration and observation.

- heading: Am I obligated to work with you for a certain length of time?
  copy: 'No. You pay on a per-month basis and are never obligated to continue working
    with us. Our platform of services is based on modern tools of application development.
    This means we build sites with the most fundamental and standard technologies
    of the web: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. So you are never ‘locked in’ to work with
    us because we don’t use custom or proprietary technologies.'

- heading: What happens if I stop working with you?
  copy: For consulting-only projects, you are entitled to any deliverables we've created
    for you. For web projects, we turn over all of your site or app's content and
    software. We will also advise you on hosting and any other necessary services.
    We are confident about our services and want to give you complete freedom over
    your relationship with us.

- heading: Will I be charged anything else besides my monthly fee?
  copy: No. Every site's fee is based on the core fee for services and any add-on
    services, such as copywriting or content migration fees. While we can't publish
    the cost of every service in advance because of their variability, we quote those
    costs to you in advance and give you complete control of what your need, when
    you need it.
