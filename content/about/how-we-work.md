- copy: Our approach is simple – we believe that an organization’s web presence is
    best served with a dedicated design and development team, rather than starting
    from scratch every few years. Ongoing observation, collaboration and continuous
    improvement of your site over time is the key to keeping your site engaging for
    your audience.
  heading: Simple approach

  tagline: We focus on people over process. Clarity over confusion. Outcomes over
    paperwork.
- copy: We use methodologies and modern tools of application development to create
    static-HTML sites and apps. They’re incredibly fast, simple and flexible and they
    deliver a level of performance that traditional CMS sites cannot. What are the
    benefits? More efficient workflow, minimal software and server upkeep and more
    dollars for design and ongoing site improvement.
  heading: Efficient technologies
  icon: /uploads/noun_654674.svg
  tagline: Static-HTML sites. Designed and developed to better adapt to changing technology
    and business landscapes.
- copy: Because of efficiencies gained in our process, we’re able to offer fixed-rate
    services through three unique monthly plans. This type of fee structure suits
    our desire to work with you on an ongoing basis. We firmly believe that’s the
    key to building and maintaining a site that serves your needs and the needs of
    your audience.
  heading: Affordable plans
  icon: /uploads/noun_685754.svg
  tagline: A pricing model that is simple, effective and scalable to your level of
    need.
