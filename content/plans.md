  copy: "'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
    \ hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the  King
    put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who  was talking.
    \ Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,  that
    all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,  and she could
    even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell  'stupid,' and that he
    had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice  muddle their slates'll be in before
    the trial's over!' thought Alice.  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.
    This of course, Alice  could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind
    him, and  very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
    \ that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out  at
    all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was  obliged
    to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was  of very little
    use, as it left no mark on the slate.  'Herald, read the accusation!' said the
    King.  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then  unrolled
    the parchment scroll, and read as follows:–  'The Queen of Hearts, she made some
    tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took
    them quite away!'"
