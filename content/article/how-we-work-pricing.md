Title: Why Choose our Pricing Model

After estimating hundreds of projects over the years I've found pricing one of the most difficult subjects and the one thing that pits clients against firms rather than have them truly be partners. Here are four observations I've made:

1) Estimates are almost always wrong. Somebody loses in this process and it's usually the client, because the firm has to pad the estimate to account for unknowns.

2) Typical flat-rate or hourly pricing do nothing to hold firms accountable for their work. Our pay-as-you-go model means that you can fire us at any time. We have to stand by our work.

3) The difference between good and great is often just time. We have always been committed to servicing non profits, human rights and cultural firms, which means budgets are tight. We've realized that everyone we worked with had ongoing needs, but budgets didn't always allow for taking our work from good to great. Everything we do, not just our pricing, is to bridge that gap and to bring best-in-class work to organizations we value.

4) The best way to manage complexity is to break it down until it's simple.

In response to these ideas we developed a simple pricing model that allows you to scale up and down to your needs.

Even though we price in months, we think of our price as a unit, so you could conceivably have two or more units in a month, or a half-unit in a month, depending on the amount or complexity of work you need done.

If you have a set budget, you can easily see if we fit for you, because you can assume that your project is:

- really small: 1-2 units (_we rarely do these except for our author product_).

- small: 3-6 units.

- medium: 9-14 units

- large: 12-24 units

After that time frame, our clients tend to scale down to half-unit per month, or even at a low maintenance rate to keep tech support, and have us at the ready for special projects or to address ongoing needs.

We've decided that to be long-term partners with our clients, we would absorb the unknowns and risk losing money in hopes that we will be working with you year-in and year-out as your organization grows and changes so that we can be a part of it.

As part of our mission we give every client a dedicated consultant to help you navigating the every changing waters of the web.
