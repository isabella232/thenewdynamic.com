## Simple approach

Our approach is simple – we believe that an organization’s web presence is best served with a dedicated design and development team, rather than starting from scratch every few years. Ongoing observation, collaboration and continuous improvement of your site over time is the key to keeping your site engaging for your audience.

We focus on people over process. Clarity over confusion. Outcomes over paperwork.

## Efficient technologies

We use methodologies and modern tools of application development to create static-HTML sites. They’re incredibly fast, simple and flexible and they deliver a level of performance that traditional CMS sites cannot. What are the benefits? More efficient workflow, minimal software and server upkeep and more dollars for design and ongoing site improvement.

Static-HTML sites. Designed and developed to better adapt to changing technology and business landscapes.

## Affordable plans

Because of efficiencies gained in building static-HTML sites, we’re able to offer fixed-rate services through three unique monthly plans. This type of fee structure suits our desire to work with you on an ongoing basis. We firmly believe that’s the key to building and maintaining a site that serves your needs and the needs of your audience.

A pricing model that is simple, effective and scalable to your level of need.
