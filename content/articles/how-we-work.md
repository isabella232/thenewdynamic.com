You learn a few things doing the same thing for 15 years. You learn what works and what doesn't; you learn your strengths and weaknesses, and you learn what really matters.

We've built the New Dynamic around a few ideas and aspirations, some of them ours, some we've learned from methodologies like agile software development, and "Lean UX."

- Great design is iterative. It doesn't magically happen on a whiteboard. It's a process that takes humility and acceptance that insight comes from observation, collaboration, and continuous improvement over time.

- Pricing in our industry is wildly variant, confusing and inequitable for mission-driven organizations.

- Communication is the #1 barrier to making every project as good as it can be.

- Accountability is earned with every touch-point, not with a mountain of paperwork.


We've addressed these issues by developing a way of working that's designed to be like we were your in-house web design and development team, but without the overhead.

1. Every account gets a dedicated consultant.   

2. We charge one-month at a time at, a rate that makes sense for you and the work you need done.  

3. We use tools and methodologies to be as efficient as possible, passing the savings on to you.  

4. We work on an ongoing basis as your team to constantly improve your website based on your needs and the needs of your audience.  


We're purists, we're passionate about our work and we love working with organizations whose work we value.
